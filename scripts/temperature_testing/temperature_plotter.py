DESCRIPTION:
    This script is ussed to plot figure from the output
    of the temperature output.
TO DO:
    1. Plot the temperature of each thermometer over time.
    2. Print the error for all 3 thermometers for different
       temperature ranges. For this, the config file should 
       also be used to ensure that the proper tracking followed.
    3. A plot of the difference between the magnetic themometer
       and the plastic thermometer over different temperature 
       values specified in the confiiguration file.
    4. Derivative of temperature increase over time, and 
       the box-whiskers at different temperature values. 
    5. eventually - if new controller added, compare average error
       over time with the average error of the new controller.
